· Analyzed and cleaned Bangalore real estate dataset containing 13,200+ records.
· Applied Feature Engineering on data to create features that work and are more accurate for ML algorithms to work on, by
applying encoding on categorial variables, Normalizing and standardizing numerical variables, outlier removal, etc.
· For model selection, ran GridSearchCV to find the most accurate machine learning regression model on train and test
sets, took the help of pickle library to export the model trained to be used by flask server.
· Exported the cleaned data in form of JSON file for the flask server to read and use.
· Used Flask library to create a server acting as an API between the website and JSON as well as pickle file.
· Designed a website to input the variables for the trained model to work on in the backend.
· Exposure: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Postman API, JSON
